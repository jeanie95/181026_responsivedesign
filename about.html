<h6>
        My name is Jiin Suh and I am a student at University of Michigan, studying passionately in UI/UX design in both School of Art and Design and School of Information. I am also a minor in Art History. 
        I am from South Korea, but it has been almost ten years since I came to the US to find and pursue my dream. My dream that I found is to create a design that can change people's mind into changing the world into a better environment.</h6>
    <h6>I have worked as a graphic designer at Amore Pacific, a Korean cosmetics company, and Korean Institution of Technology and Science Information. I can comfortably use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Xd, and Final Cut Pro X. 
        With these programs, I have previously developed prototypes of mobile apps, designed brands and created posters and banners. 
    </h6>
    <h6>The reason I started to have interest in User-Interface was when I realized that design could not only satisfy the vision but can also control and influence people's thoughts and actions. 
        I always knew that I was very emotional and empathic as I met people from different culture, background, and societies. It has been almost ten years since I decided to come to the US for a better environment where I could explore my choices to ultimately find what I wanted. From pursuing art from high school, it was impressive to see how every details, like colors and texture, could affect the viewers. 
        The power of the visual was more than I thought. 
            For first few years in the US, I lived with 8 others girls, sharing rooms and basically everything. My social life did not have an end after school, but continued even at home. 
            Through these years, I learned how to coexist within a community as well as to be responsible and mature as being one of the oldest girls in the house. Taking care of people around me and considering what other might think or feel became a part of who I am. 
            Some might think I am too vulnerable but I think I just feel that my emotions are more delicate, which I believe will lead me to have a better understanding of the users. 
            </h6>
        </div>
    <h5>[This too shall pass.]</h5> <h6>This is a saying that I would say to myself every time I ran into difficult situation. All the years being alone, I figured out my own way to stay calm from any unexpected problems. I try to put all my worries behind especially when things do not work as I wanted. 
            I do not let my emotions control me. Because I am not afraid of facing problems, I am very adventurous and brave when it comes to trying new things. I do not hesitate from getting outside my box, but try to find more. I knew that I had difficulty of talking to new people, so I became the academic peer advisor of Stamps School of Art&Design. I was the first international student to be an advisor and I have been working for over two years now. As a peer advisor, I got the chance to meet fellow students, professors and advisors, which became a very special experience for me. Also, I did not limit my learning as a designer by taking classes from School of Information to learn experience design and programming (Python, HTML, CSS) and from History of Art minor for design inspiration. 
        </h6>
        
           <h5> [Nothing is worthless.]</h5><h6> Believing that every moment, every experience and every choice becomes who I am, I try to explore as much as possible. That is why I have worked at an exhibition of one of my favorite artist, a government-run Science and Technology institution and a cosmetics company. 
            Through all these experience, I was able to build my skills not only in design but also in communication, and data analysis. The opportunity at the KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information) started as an one month part-time. However, by committing to all the tasks I was given, I was able to extend my responsibilities into video editing, designing posters and banners and analyzing data and soon, my one month part-time job became a eight months contract job as a design professional. I am confident that I would be able to show as much potential throughout the time and in any given tasks.
